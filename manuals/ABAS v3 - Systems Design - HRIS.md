# **2. System Overview**

## **2.1 HRIS Architecture**

The HRIS within ABAS v3 is designed as an integrated module within the larger system architecture. It shares data and interacts with other modules, such as payroll and finance, while maintaining a distinct focus on HR functions.

ABAS v3 has been upgraded to utilize CodeIgniter on the backend with RESTful APIs and React.Next on the frontend for enhanced performance and user experience. This architecture allows for a more modular and scalable system, enabling easier maintenance and updates.

The following diagram provides a visual representation of the HRIS architecture and its key components:

*figure â€¦*

# **3. Data Management**

## **3.1 Data Structure**

The HRIS within ABAS v3 employs a relational database structure to organize and manage HR data efficiently. This structure uses tables to store data elements and defines relationships between these tables, ensuring data integrity and consistency. The database structure may have been modified in ABAS v3 to accommodate the new technologies and HRIS functionalities.

### **Tables:**

The database comprises various tables, each dedicated to specific HR entities, such as employees, positions, departments, leave records, performance reviews, and more. Each table contains a set of fields that store relevant attributes of the entity. For example, the "Employees" table might include fields like Employee ID, Name, Address, Date of Birth, Job Title, Department, etc.

figure here

### **Relationships:**

Relationships between tables establish connections based on common fields. For instance, the "Employees" table might have a relationship with the "Departments" table based on the "Department ID" field, allowing the system to link employees to their respective departments.

figure here

### **Data Dictionary:**

A data dictionary provides detailed descriptions of each table and field within the database, including data types, formats, and any validation rules. This dictionary serves as a valuable reference for understanding the structure and meaning of HR data.

*figure here*

## **3.2 Data Security and Privacy**

Protecting sensitive HR data is a top priority. The HRIS incorporates various security measures to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability:

- **Access Controls:** The system implements role-based access control (RBAC), granting users access to data and functionalities based on their roles and responsibilities. This ensures that only authorized personnel can access and modify specific HR data.
- **Data Encryption:** Sensitive data, such as employee identification numbers, salary information, and performance reviews, is encrypted both in transit and at rest. This protects data from unauthorized access even if a security breach occurs.
- **Audit Trails:** The system maintains audit trails that record all data access, modifications, and deletions. This provides a history of data changes and helps to identify any unauthorized or suspicious activity.
- **Regular Backups:** The HRIS database is regularly backed up to ensure data recovery in case of system failures or data loss incidents.
- **Data Privacy Compliance:** The system adheres to relevant data privacy regulations in the Philippines, particularly the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173). This Act outlines the principles of data privacy, rights of data subjects, and obligations of data controllers and processors. The HRIS ensures compliance with this Act by implementing appropriate security measures, obtaining consent for data collection and processing, and providing data subjects with access to and control over their personal information.

## **3.3 Data Integration**

- **System Integration:** The HRIS may integrate with other systems within the organization, such as payroll systems, benefits providers, or time and attendance systems. Integration allows for seamless data flow between systems, reducing data redundancy and improving data accuracy.

## **3.4 Data Quality and Maintenance**

Maintaining high-quality HR data is essential for accurate reporting, informed decision-making, and efficient HR operations. The HRIS includes features to support data quality:

- **Data Validation:** Validation rules are implemented to ensure that data entered into the system meets predefined criteria. This helps to prevent errors and maintain data consistency.
- **Data Cleansing:** Regular data cleansing activities, such as identifying and correcting duplicate records or outdated information, help to improve data accuracy.
- **Data Governance:** Establishing data governance policies and procedures helps to ensure that data is managed consistently and responsibly across the organization.

By implementing robust data management practices, the HRIS ensures that HR data is accurate, secure, and readily available to support HR operations and strategic decision-making.

# **5. Workflows and Processes**

## **5.1 Process Maps**

The HRIS in ABAS v3 may have revised or automated some HR processes. Detailed process maps or flowcharts illustrate the steps involved in key HR processes, such as:

**Recruitment Process:** From creating a job requisition to onboarding a new hire.

**Performance Review Process:** From setting goals to conducting performance appraisals.

figure â€¦

**Leave Request Process:** From submitting a leave request to approval and recording.

figure â€¦

**Offboarding Process:** From initiating termination to finalizing employee records.

figure â€¦

**Manpower Request Process:** From a department manager submitting a manpower request to HR reviewing, approving, and fulfilling the request.

figure â€¦

## 5.2 Process Automation

ABAS v3 leverages automation to streamline HR workflows, such as:

- **Automated Notifications:** For leave requests, performance reviews, manpower requests, and other HR-related tasks.
- **Automated Approval Workflows:** For leave requests, travel authorizations, manpower requests, and other approvals.
- **Automated Data Entry:** For time and attendance tracking, benefits enrollment, and other data entry tasks.

## **5.3 Processes Initiated Outside HRIS**

While the HRIS manages core HR functions, some processes may be initiated outside the system, such as:

- **Manpower Requests:** Department managers or supervisors may submit manpower requests through a separate system or process, which are then integrated into the HRIS for review and fulfillment.
- **Training Nominations:** Department heads may nominate employees for training programs through a separate process, which is then integrated into the HRIS for tracking and management.
- **Performance Improvement Plans:** Managers may initiate performance improvement plans outside the HRIS, but the plans can be linked to employee records in the system for tracking and monitoring progress.
- **Promotion Requests:** A manager or supervisor may submit a request for an employee's promotion through a separate process, which is then integrated with the HRIS for review, approval, and implementation.
- **Incident Reports:** Employees may submit incident reports through a separate system or process, which are then forwarded to HR for review and appropriate action.
- **Notice to Explain (NTE) Requests:** A manager or supervisor may request HR to issue a Notice to Explain (NTE) to an employee through a separate process. This request is then integrated into the HRIS, allowing HR to document, track, and manage the NTE process, including the employee's response and any subsequent actions.

These processes, while initiated outside the HRIS, are still integrated into the system to ensure a centralized and comprehensive view of HR activities.

## **5.4 Incident Report and NTE Relationship**

The HRIS can establish a relationship between incident reports and NTEs. When an incident report is filed in response to an NTE, the system can tag them as related, allowing HR to track the entire sequence of events and actions taken. This helps to ensure that appropriate disciplinary measures are taken and that all relevant documentation is linked for future reference.

# **6. Use Cases**
